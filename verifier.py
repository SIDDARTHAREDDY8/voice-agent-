"""The reliability layer — the part competitors make their moat.

A raw LLM will happily record whatever the rep said. Production RCM can't: a
wrong copay or a missed reference number costs money. This runs deterministic
checks over the extracted record and returns human-readable flags. In a real
system these flags would trigger a re-ask on the live call or route to a human.
